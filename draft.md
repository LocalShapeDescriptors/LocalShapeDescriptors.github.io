## Abstract

We present a novel loss function for neuron segmentation in electron microscopy
volumes, which is based on the prediction of local shape descriptors (LSDs). The
LSDs serve as an auxiliary learning task describing the local shape of objects
in order to improve generated affinities and subsequent segmentations. We
conduct a large scale comparative study of competing methods across various
specimen, imaging techniques, and resolutions. The results suggest that LSDs
consistently help to improve accuracy over a range of metrics on all
investigated datasets. We consolidate all data and present a new benchmark for
the connectomics community.
